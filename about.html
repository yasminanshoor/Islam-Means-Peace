      <h2>This Campaign Aims To Tackle Prejudice Against Muslims</h2><br>
        <p> Many misconceptions of Islam and Muslims have led many people to develop stigmas and stereotypes
          about the religion as a whole. Some people believe Islam to be a violent religion due to their
          overgeneralisation of the behaviours of minority "Islamic" terrorist groups. The Islam Means Peace
          campaign aims to address these misconstrued perceptions of the peaceful religion of Islam. It is
          important for these people to understand that these terrorist organisations do not represent Islam
          at all, and for them to understand what Islam truly stands for. It is not a religion of violence,
          but rather one that teaches peace and humility. This campaign also aims to address the distorted
          views of Islam presented in the media. </p>
        <br><h2>Our Goals</h2>
        <ol><p>
        <li>Spread awareness of this prejudice and address it</li>
        <li>Remove negative stereotypes that result in Islamaphobia</li>
        <li>Address the medias role in Islamaphobia</li>
        <li>Take a step closer to a better, less prejudice world</li>
        </p></ol><br>

        <h2>Using the hashtag #IslamMeansPeace</h2>
        <p>The #IslamMeansPeace hashtag is to spread awareness of the prejudice faced by many Muslims today
          due to the negative stereotypes and prejudices against Muslims. Use the # and take to social media
          to share your story. Every story shared brings this cause more awareness </p><br><br><br>

        <h4>Step 3: The Medias Role in Islamaphobia</h4>
        <img src="images/media.jpeg" alt"media"></img>
        <h5> Phrases that are commonly associated with muslim terrorists in the media are "Islamic terror"
          and "Islamic fundementalism".
          However, when addressing white terrorists, the label of their race or identity is commonly left out.
          Media today has normalised the phrase "Islamic terrorist" so much that the association between the
          has become normalised. Firstly, it is important to recognise that when the media refers to a
          terror attack as "Islamist", they are actually referring to a minority group of extremists.
          According to what the holy book of Islam (the Quran) states and represents, they are not Muslims
          at all. Thus, is it fair to use the term "Islamist", which represents a peaceful religion, to label
          these extremists.
